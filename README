We have a dictionary student. We change the age key of the dictionary to 21. We add a key grade with value "A".
we create an array subjects with elements "Maths","Physics" and "Chemistry". We push elements one by one from 
the subjects array to the courses key of the student dictionary. Next, we show the index of the element "Physics".
Then, we slice the array to create a new array with elements ,"Maths" and "Physics".
